Yes, you may need to set up ngrok for Jenkins GitHub webhook
if your Jenkins server is not accessible from the internet.

Ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel from the public internet
to a local machine, allowing you to expose a web server running on your
local machine to the internet.

By using ngrok, you can expose your Jenkins server to the internet,
and GitHub can send webhook events to your Jenkins server via the ngrok tunnel.
